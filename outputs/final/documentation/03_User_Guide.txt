          |          | • May have specific challenges
          |          | • Revisit after market changes

5.2 Reading Location Profiles

When you click a top location, you see:

🏆 Overall Score
• Primary metric for ranking
• Higher is better
• Compare across locations

👥 Population Density
• Market size indicator
• >50,000/km² = Very high
• >20,000/km² = High
• >10,000/km² = Moderate

🏪 Competition
• Number of existing stores
• 0 = No competition (BEST)
• 1-5 = Low competition (GOOD)
• 6-15 = Moderate competition (OKAY)
• >15 = High competition (CHALLENGING)

🎯 Amenity Score
• Foot traffic potential
• Based on nearby facilities
• Higher = More foot traffic
• >15 = Excellent
• 10-15 = Very Good
• 5-10 = Good

5.3 Understanding Market Gaps

Underserved Areas have:
✅ Good population (>1,000 people)
✅ Low competition (<3 stores)
✅ Reasonable accessibility
✅ Market gap score >60

Why they matter:
• First-mover advantage
• Lower marketing costs
• Unmet demand
• Growth potential

5.4 Common Patterns to Look For

🎯 Ideal Sweet Spot
• High population (>40,000/km²)
• Low competition (0-5 stores)
• Good amenities (>10 score)
• Near major roads (<500m)
→ These are your TOP priorities!

⚠️ Saturated Markets
• High competition (>15 stores)
• High foot traffic (>20 amenities)
• May still work with:
  - Unique offering
  - Better service
  - Superior location within area

🌱 Growth Opportunities
• Moderate population (10k-30k/km²)
• Zero competition
• Improving infrastructure
→ Good for long-term investment
